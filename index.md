## 📜 Description

This Python script allows you to create mnemonic phrases and continuously saves them in the `seed.txt` file. After every 100 generated mnemonic phrases, a message is shown asking if you want to continue. This application helps in generating phrases for storing cryptographic seed keys, making it easier to remember complex sequences.
